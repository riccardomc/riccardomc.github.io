      <description>I used to have a blog. It was right at this URL. When I moved to the Netherlands at the end of 2011 I published a post that went viral. It was in Italian but random people on the internet translated it in Spanish and English. Some national Italian news relaunched it too.
I wiped my blog off the Internet a few years ago. At some point I decided that it was a bit too radical.</description>
