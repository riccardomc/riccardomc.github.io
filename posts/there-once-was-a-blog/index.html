<p>I used to have a blog. It was right at this URL. When I moved to the Netherlands at the
end of 2011 I published a
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111020060019/http://riccardo.cefala.net/2011/10/io-amo-i-black-bloc/">post</a>
that went viral. It was in Italian but random people on the internet translated it in
Spanish and English. Some national Italian news relaunched it too.</p>
<p>I wiped my blog off the Internet a few years ago. At some point I decided that it was a
bit too radical. Radical opinions are not very professional. And I thought I needed to be
professional. Don&rsquo;t <a href="https://simone.substack.com/p/we-all-have-to-eat">we all have to
eat</a>, after all?</p>
<p>Almost ten years later I suspect that none of that made sense to begin with anyway. I am
no longer worried about being professional. I&rsquo;d rather be radical again. I&rsquo;d rather be
authentic. I&rsquo;d rather be right. But how authentic are we even
<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158501/timnit-gebru-team-google-public-statement-fired"><em>allowed</em></a>
to be these days?</p>
<p>Pseudoscience and algorithmic selection reward uniformity of thought and skew opinions
according to business needs.  They are chipping our authenticity away. Hindering our
ability to be right. Little by little. One
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Listicle">listicle</a> at a time. Turning independent
thinkers into outcasts. I suspect the proliferation of conspiracy theories and fake news
is also a side effect of this same mechanisms.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no longer about truth, about being right. It&rsquo;s about SEO optimization, about local
optima. Your opinion is dangerous if you can&rsquo;t monetize it. It&rsquo;s about world-wide tribal
groupthink.  You&rsquo;re in or you&rsquo;re out. Nuances might clog the system because there&rsquo;s no
computational power allocated for those.  Computer said &ldquo;<em>no</em>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What if you <em>are</em> right? What if the outlier is <em>you</em>? You might be just outside of the
confidence interval.  You might still be right. What if the hypothesis or the training
set was partial?</p>
<p>I like to think that post went viral because I saw things slightly differently than the
overwhelming majority. Because I was radical. Because I was right. And I somehow had the
courage of writing that down and publish it.</p>
<p>It takes more courage to be right these days. But no one should be afraid of being right.
Or, even better, no one should be afraid of being wrong.</p>
