      <description>Ciao, I&amp;rsquo;m Riccardo. This is my website. Here I try to be authentic, keep it simple, and write about things that make me happy. You are a welcome guest.
You can send me an email if you like.
I code and build clouds. Once I helped build one that sold for a lot of money. We had such a great time.
This is a picture of me I like. My wife took it in 2016 while in New York.</description>
