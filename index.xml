      <description>Ciao. I am Riccardo. This is my website. Here I try to be authentic, keep it simple, and write about things that make me happy. You are a welcome guest.
If you feel like you can send me an email.
I code and build clouds. Once I helped build one that sold for a lot of money. We had such a great time.
This is a picture of me. My wife took it in 2016 while were in New York.</description>
