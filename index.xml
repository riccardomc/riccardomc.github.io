      <description>I used to have a blog. It was right at this URL. When I moved to the Netherlands at the end of 2011 I published a post that went viral. It was in Italian but random people on the internet translated it in Spanish and English. Some national Italian news relaunched it too.
I wiped my blog off the Internet a few years ago. At some point I decided that it was a bit too radical.</description>

      <description>Ciao. I am Riccardo Cefala. This is my website. Here I try to be authentic, keep it simple, and write about things that make me happy. You are a welcome guest.
If you feel like you can send me an email.
I code and build clouds. Once I helped build one that sold for a lot of money. We had such a great time.
This is a picture of me. My wife took it in 2016 while in New York.</description>
