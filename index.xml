      <description>the singularity Recently I came across this very interesting article about the tendency of companies to outsource critical portions of their businesses.
 If you outsource too much? Is there a point where you cannot go back and relearn how actually making things work?
 And I realized that I think about this often in my work as a cloud consultant. Are companies besides themselves with cloud adoption? Am I helping them build systems that are too complex for them to handle?</description>

      <description>Last Saturday I renewed my AWS Solutions Architect - Professional Certification for the third time. Admittedly, I walked in the exam with much less confidence than I am used to. The main difference was that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have the luxury of full, uninterrupted focus this time around: three years ago, in fact, I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a baby and I had a stable, full-time job that allowed me plenty of time to prepare.</description>

      <description>I used to have a blog. It was right at this URL. When I moved to the Netherlands at the end of 2011 I published a post that went viral. It was in Italian but random people on the internet translated it in Spanish and English. Some national Italian news relaunched it too.
I wiped my blog off the Internet a few years ago. At some point I decided that it was a bit too radical.</description>

      <description>Ciao. I am Riccardo Cefala. This is my website. Here I try to be authentic, keep it simple, and write about things that make me happy. You are a welcome guest.
If you feel like you can send me an email.
I code and build clouds. Once I helped build one that sold for a lot of money. We had such a great time.
This is a picture of me. My wife took it in 2016 while in New York.</description>
